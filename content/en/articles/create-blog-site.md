title: Introducing Myself as a Two-Year Japanese Programmer in my First Blog Post
description: Nice to meet you, I am UNYOOON. It has been a year and a half since I started working as a programmer. It's about time I made up my mind to start a serious blog site. I haven't been writing code at work lately, so I decided to develop my own blog site as a refresher. As this is my first blog post, I would like to introduce myself.

## My time as a technical college where I lived a self-indulgent life

Some of you may not know about technical colleges, so I will give a brief explanation.

The official name of a technical college is "kotosen gakko" (college of technology).

As the name suggests, a technical college is a combination of a high school and a vocational school.

In terms of academic background, a college of technology is

- Junior high school (3 years) → Technical college (5 years) → University transfer (2 years) or employment

It is like this. (Some students stop in the third year and go on to university.)

Five years is quite a long time, but it is surprisingly enjoyable because you will learn specialized knowledge from the very beginning of your studies, as the name "technical college" implies.

Most technical colleges have student dormitories, so in my case, I had a lot of fun playing around with friends, eating out at Sukiya at night, and drinking a lot of alcohol.

Also, in the 4th and 5th year of college of technology, you have to do research and write a thesis in order to graduate, just like at university, but I spent half of my 5th year research period playing mahjong in the lab and didn't do much research at all.

I was living my life as a student with little study, so I didn't have the skills or experience to go to a big company for job hunting. (In case you are wondering, they make you learn specialized knowledge from the beginning of your schooling, so you can develop some technical skills there.)



## Married upon graduation from a technical college and went to work for a venture IT company

I was leading such a self-indulgent life, and since I did not have the grades to go on to higher education, I started job hunting around April of my 5th year.

There were many job offers at technical colleges, and if I chose one of them, I was almost always accepted.

However, the salaries were still low, so I tried applying for jobs at large companies such as NTT Data, which did not have any job openings at technical colleges.

Well, I usually failed.

As a result, I accepted a job offer at a venture company with a good salary that was among the job openings at the technical college, and I was successful.

As I lived in Saitama Prefecture, I was quite satisfied with the fact that I could work at a venture company in Minato Ward.

However, a short time after receiving the job offer, I was sent to a rural area. 。。。。

I was sad to be separated from my girlfriend at the time, so I proposed to her and we got married.

Looking back, I wonder how she even agreed to it, but I am glad that we are now living happily ever after.



## Unsuccessful new graduates

After I joined the company, I was put in charge of the development of the company's services, from planning to design and development, almost exclusively by new graduates.

Of course, we didn't know where to start and things didn't go well.

There were many complaints about the neglected environment at the time.

However, I became much more accustomed to it as I repeatedly launched projects and had them disintegrate in mid-air.

I think I experienced about four or five different projects over the course of a year. None of them went well, lol.

Looking back, I am really grateful that I was given such a variety of experiences.

Since there were no customers, I think I was allowed to work quite freely on the projects.

In a venture company, the second year is the middle of your career, so from now on I would like to use the experience I gained to lead more and more projects to success.



## Blogging for output and personal growth

This is my self-introduction.

How was it? I think I've been quite lucky.

I used to live a self-indulgent life as a technical college student, but I got a job at a venture company and started to think that I wanted to grow more.

I wake up early in the morning to read books, write blogs, and output.

I still haven't gotten rid of the self-defeating part of me, so I'm still unmotivated and it's not going well, but I'm starting with outputting on my blog for now lol.

I like to create things, so I am also developing a blog site on my own.

I'll post articles on the technical aspects of the blog site soon.

Now that I have laid the groundwork, I hope that my blogging will lead to personal growth as I continue to work on it.
