## EC Overview

In a nutshell, EC is "buying and selling products and services online. Amazon" is a typical example of EC.

Amazon is not a site that deals only in physical goods. In addition to physical products, Amazon also handles e-books, movies, animations, and other videos. Buying and selling these non-physical goods and services in general online is called EC.


## Origin of EC

How did EC come into being?

It can be seen by looking at how the buying and selling of goods and services has changed.

In the beginning, when telecommunication devices were not widely distributed, businesses had to have a "physical store" to sell their products. However, when communication devices such as cell phones became widespread and it became possible to handle a large number of calls, "mail order" was born, in which consumers browsed through catalogs and ordered dismantled products by phone. Later, when the Internet became widely available, "e-commerce sites" were born, allowing consumers to select products online and order them directly from the Internet.

As you can see, the buying and selling of products has changed over time, but all forms of sales have not disappeared. This is because every form of sales has its advantages and disadvantages.


## Merits and demerits of EC

EC is now a world where many individuals and businesses have entered the market and most things can be purchased online. The reason why the world of EC has grown so large is that it offers advantages to both consumers and businesses that are not available in brick-and-mortar stores.

The major advantage for consumers is that they can order products with a few simple operations on the website and have them delivered to their homes without having to go to a store. With the current situation in Corona, the ability to buy products online without going out is a very big advantage.

On the other hand, one of the disadvantages is that because it is online, there are concerns about whether the products will really be delivered or not, or about not being able to see the store clerk's face. With major e-commerce sites, you have the peace of mind that everyone is using them, but when you start your own e-commerce site or use an overseas e-commerce site, these concerns can have a big impact, especially if you are not sure if you will receive your products online or not.

However, mechanisms are evolving to resolve these concerns. For example, "live chat", which allows customers to chat online, and "omni-channel", which provides multiple sales channels, such as physical stores and online e-commerce, and shares all information with them.

The advantages on the vendor side are that initial costs can be reduced on a small scale by being able to develop a business without a storefront, and sales efficiency and profits can be increased by analyzing customers' personal information and purchasing information in detail and introducing appropriate advertisements and products to the right users.

However, these advantages and disadvantages can be divided according to the type of EC.


## Types of EC

EC can be divided into two main types.

The first is "in-house EC.

In-house EC is a type of EC where you build and manage your own EC site.

Although it is necessary to build the EC site and manage the system and security, by using a package, etc., there are cases where the operation, maintenance, and security measures can be left to the system provider.

One of the advantages of in-house EC is the ability to create a unique EC site, which makes branding easier. This can help your brand gain fans and repeat customers, and keep you from getting caught up in price competition.

However, there is a disadvantage in that it requires more time and cost to build and operate the site in-house, as well as to use a package.

The second is "mall-based EC."

Mall e-commerce means selling products on major e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Rakuten, and Yahoo!

Although there are fees involved, there is no need to create your own website, and running costs and initial costs are lower than if you operated your own website.

On the other hand, it can be difficult to create uniqueness and branding because you are bound by the mall's rules and events, or you cannot acquire customer data and use it for marketing purposes.

Therefore, it is important to distinguish between different types of EC depending on the type of EC you want to achieve.


## Future of EC

The need for EC is increasing due to the widespread use of smartphones among people of all ages and the voluntary restraint of going out due to the coronation.

To meet such needs, the number of packaged systems and platforms for opening EC sites has been increasing, making it easier to start an EC business. However, when starting an EC business, it is important to clarify the vision of what kind of EC you want to create, which will lead to increased sales for your EC business.

Recently, the methods and functions for analyzing acquired data have been evolving rapidly, and such analysis will enable you to develop targeted products and branding to attract customers and improve sales.

This is a summary of my research on EC!

Next time, I think I will have a chance to look into global EC and cross-border EC, so I will write an article about those as well.
