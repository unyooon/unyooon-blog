## Overview of EC

EC, in short, is "buying and selling products and services online". Something you may all know is "Amazon" which is a representative example of EC.

Sometimes, people misunderstand that EC only refers to buying and selling physical items online. But it's not just limited to that. Amazon also handles products such as e-books, movies, animations and more. So, the buying and selling of any product or service online is called EC.

## How EC came about

So, how did EC come about?

The changes in the buying and selling of products and services show that.

Initially, when communication equipment was not widely distributed, businesses had to have "physical stores" to sell items. However, as communication equipment such as mobile phones became widespread and able to handle many calls, "catalogue sales" were born. Consumers could then view catalogs and order items by phone. After that, when the Internet became widely used, "EC websites", which allow customers to order items online, were created.

This way, buying and selling has changed over time, but all the sales methods still exist. That's because each sales method has its own advantages and disadvantages.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of EC

EC is becoming a world where most things can be bought online, with many individuals and businesses entering the market. The reason EC has become so big is that it has advantages for both consumers and businesses that are not available with store sales.

Specifically, a consumer's advantage is that you can order items with a small amount of site operations and have them delivered to your home without going to a store. Currently, with the situation of COVID, being able to buy items only online is a huge advantage.

On the other hand, disadvantages include not being sure if the item will really be delivered since it is online, and the uncertainty of not being able to see the face of a store clerk. Although major EC sites may be reassuring, this uncertainty is especially significant when starting your own EC site or using EC overseas.

However, systems have evolved to address these uncertainties. Specifically, there are "live chat" functions available on online sites, as well as "omnichannel" systems that prepare multiple sales routes, such as online and physical stores, and share all information through them.

The advantage for a business side is that you can expand business without having a physical store, and that the start-up cost is lower, especially if the business is small scale. Furthermore, by analyzing customer information and purchasing information in detail, and by providing appropriate advertisements and products to appropriate users, it is possible to increase sales efficiency and profit.

However, these advantages and disadvantages can be divided according to the type of EC.

## Types of EC

EC can be divided into two main types:

1."In-house EC"

In-house EC refers to building and managing an EC site on your own. Building and managing the system and security are necessary, but you can also outsource the maintenance and security measures to the system provider using packages.

The advantage of in-house EC is that you can create a unique EC site and make branding easier. This can lead to more repeat customers and not being caught in price competition. However, it may also increase labor and cost.

2."Mall EC"

Mall EC refers to selling products on major EC sites such as Amazon, Rakuten, and Yahoo! Shopping.

Although there are fees involved, it is easier to start with a mall EC as there is no need to create a website and the initial and running costs are less than managing on your own. However, it is difficult to create originality as you are limited by the mall's rules and events and it may be harder to gather customer data for marketing.

Therefore, it is important to decide which type of EC you want to aim for based on your goals.

## Future of EC

With the widespread use of smartphones regardless of age, and the influence of COVID-19, the demand for EC is increasing.

In response, the number of package systems and platforms for setting up EC sites have increased, making it easier to start with EC. However, it is important to note that starting an EC business is not just about creating a website, but also about managing and expanding it in the long term.

Recently, as data analysis methods and functions have continued to evolve, it is possible to use such analysis to conduct targeted product development and branding, and to increase customer acquisition and sales.
